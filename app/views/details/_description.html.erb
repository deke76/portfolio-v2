<p>I have always been interested in programming, math & logic based problem solving which lead me down a technical sales path.  Originally, that was geared towards instrumentation & automation because I enjoyed the technical aspects of the process control industry.</p>
<p>Dealing with level, flow, pressure & various types of analtyical measurement required me to use some of my math & physics education to develop a basic unders &ing of spectroscopy, near infra-read, ultrasound, EMR, nuclear & physicalal types of measurement.  Additionally, my discussions taught me a lot about how these processes related to what how industrial businesses operated & the effect of a process on corporate profitability.</p>
<p>Like everyone else, I have ideas about things I want to create so I finally took the plunge & enrolled in <%= link_to "Lighthouse Labs", "http://lighthouselabs.ca", target: :blank %> for a guided tour of web development.  A difficult 13 weeks but time I ultimately enjoyed & now I'm developing my ability to code & build projects in different languages in order to feed my creative soul.</p>
<p>Coding isn't all I do though, I have a young family with two amazing daughters & a wife that I adore.  I am a huge hockey fan (Go Flames Go) & enjoy working out & wood work.  If you want to know a little more about me feel free to have a look at my socials.</p>
